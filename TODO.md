# TODO List

## Tasks

* Understand how to use Phoenix Tuner to quickly tune PID values for things
* Finish ultrasonic wall following code (Peter)
* Write code for vision tracking aiming (Jack)
  * Point turret to the target
  * Rename NetworkTables in RobotInit to something not-testy
* Move to Turret target (Billy)
  * Spin robot to align with camera
* Center turret on robot (Billy)
  * Opposite of the above
* Derek says that if the control panel manipulator is deployed, shooting is risky.  Lets avoid that.
* Take a seccond look at autonomus commands: 
* Trim commands: we don't need THIS many
  * perhaps group commands into packages?
* Peter: Have a group discussion on CommandBased robots
* Figure out Tilt motor
* Test and complete visionary auto-target

## Stuff that needs a competition robot (or parts thereof) to be tested

## Long term goals

* DOCUMENT THE CODE MORE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
* Look at shrinking classes to be a more reasonable size
* Organize RobotMap: perhaps have encapsulated classes that arrange constants by type
